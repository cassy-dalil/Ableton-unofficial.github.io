                    What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: 
                    helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

                    We've learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a widers set of perspectives.
                    We don't always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                    Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. 
                    Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
